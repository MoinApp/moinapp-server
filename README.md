# MoinApp Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MoinApp/moinapp-server.svg?branch=feature/go-rewrite)](https://travis-ci.org/MoinApp/moinapp-server)

The server for Moin.
The server is deployed to http://moinapp.herokuapp.com/ (this link is funny).

## Development

Running `go build` in this directory should build the application with all of its dependencies. The result will be an executable called `moinapp-server`. This is the entire server.

For improved build times run `go install` once so that all dependencies are cached.

## Bugs

Bug reports are welcome. Post them [here](https://github.com/MoinApp/moinapp-server/issues).
